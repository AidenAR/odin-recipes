    </ul>

    <h4> <em> Instructions: </em> </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place a cold soup pot over medium heat. Add sliced bacon.
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the fat has
            rendered out and the bacon begins to crisp up, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain off most of the excess fat with a paper towel if desired,
            leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pot.
            Add onions, celery, and salt. Saute until and softened onions
            turn translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in black pepper, cayenne, dried thyme, dried oregano,
            and tomato paste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
            the tomato paste starts to caramelize onto the bottom
            of the pan, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the minced garlic, and cook,
            stirring, for 1 to 2 more minutes.
            Stir in chicken broth and water and raise the heat to high.
            Bring to a simmer over high heat; reduce heat to medium and let
            simmer while you prep the Swiss chard.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chard leaves from tough stems.
            Gather a handful of leaves and slice across in one direction;
            turn and slice across again. Repeat with remaining chard.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place into a bowl and fill with water.
            Swish around to remove dirt;
            Transfer washed greens a handful at a time to another bowl to drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir the Swiss chard into the pot and simmer over medium heat
            until greens become tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>
            Stir in the drained beans and raise the heat to high; bring to a boil,
            and stir in pasta and reduce heat to medium-high.
            Cook until the pasta is tender, stirring occasionally, 12 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the pasta is tender, check the seasoning. Serve immediately in large bowls.
            Garnish with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, and red pepper flakes.
        </li>
    </ol>
