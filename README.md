# odin-recipes
Odin Project: Recipes-The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few holiday recipes!
This project was built using only raw, basic HTML skills which I've learnt from the Odin Project Foundations Course; and I'll definitely update it later as I hone my craft and learn a bit of CSS and Javascript in the near future; so stay tuned for more and thanks for viewing!
